            <h2>Environmental Context</h2>
            
            <h3>Policy and Legal environment</h3>
            <p>At national level, there has been good will and consolidated efforts from the government of Uganda and the East African Community, to develop an enabling policy and legal framework for operations where peace building, conflict resolution and transformation have been emphasized. During implementation of the work plan, BTF will seek and make use of the opportunities to influence and empower households so as to achieve their rights.</p>
            
            <h3>Political Environment</h3>
            <p>Although the government of Uganda has worked hard at democratizing and decentralizing her proceedings, the country still has many challenges related to the political environment including lack of public accountability, failure of leaders to execute their mandate, politicization of development work in communities, and increased corruption.</p>
            <p>Such circumstances have continued to affect the security and livelihoods of women. Hence, BTF will strengthen her cooperation and collaboration with the central and the local governments in her operation areas to find solutions to these challenges in order to foster community development.</p>
            
            <h3>Economic Environment</h3>
            <p>Economic stability is key to BTF's successful implementation of activities. However, Uganda continues to be affected by economic related challenges including high inflation rates, high cost of poverty particularly in BTF operation areas where the poverty levels are alarming. In addition the climatic conditions in Uganda have further worsened rural farmers' lives due to the fact that they are very unpredictable and this makes planning very difficult. In 2024, BTF will take into consideration such issues in order to effectively implement her plan.</p>
            
            <h3>Social Environment</h3>
            <p>In 2024, BTF will be sensitive to the community dynamics, the social norms and values in the communities that she intends to work in; BTF will pay attention to addressing social injustices that are sustained through cultural practices which negatively affect communities, especially poor children and women. Such issues include gender based violence, low decision-making and shaming bad cultural practices that disable women from effectively participate in communal work which is geared towards improving their livelihoods.</p>
